    <h3>Embedded content from other websites</h3>

    <p>
    Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
    </p>

    <p>
    These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
    </p>

    <h3>Analytics</h3>

    <p>
    This website uses Google Analytics to help analyze how visitors use this site. Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are small text files placed on your computer, to collect standard internet log information and visitor behavior information in an
    anonymous form. Note the deliberate emphasis of anonymous, as no personally identifiable information, is collected about you unless you explicitly submit that information on this website.
    </p>

    <p>
    The anonymous information generated by Google Analytics cookies about your use of this website is transmitted to Google – not Straightline Refrigeration. This information is processed to compile statistical reports on website activity for this site only.
     Straightline Refrigeration uses these reports to evaluate aggregate visitor usage so that we can optimize the content, and its marketing, to better meet your needs. This is essential for Straightline Refrigeration to operate this website as a free to use service.
    </p>

    <h2 class="primaryText">Cookie Policy</h2>

    <p>
    A cookie is a small file containing data which is saved to the computer or device you're using when you visit a website. When you return to a website, these cookies are read by that site and often used to identify you and your preferences. No personal information, such as your name or address, is stored in cookies.
    </p>

    <p>
    Remember that as cookies are device based, if you use our website on your desktop and on your mobile, cookies will be saved to both devices.
    </p>

    <h4>
    Types of cookie
    </h4>

    <p>
    There are different types of cookies we use depending on what we need them for.
    </p>

    <h4>
    Persistent vs session cookies
    </h4>

    <p>
    A cookie can either be persistent (long term) or session (short term) based. We use both. Persistent cookies remain on your device after you have closed your browser window.
    These cookies are used to remember you when you next return to a website, or for remarketing purposes, so that when you are on a different website we can show you an advertising banner.
    Persistent cookies stay on your browser until their expiry date or if you should decide to delete them, which you can do through the browser you're using.
    </p>

    <p>
    A session cookie only stays on your browser for as long as you are using a particular website; it is deleted as soon as you close the browser. Session cookies are needed, among other things,
    to remember who you are when you move from page to page on a website.
    </p>

    <h4>
    First and third-party cookies
    </h4>

    <p>
    A cookie can also be a first party cookie or a third-party cookie. First party cookies are those set by the website you visited. All other cookies are third party. We use both.
    We only work with trusted partners when using third party cookies. These include performance cookies, which help us track visits or revenue to partner websites, analytics cookies
    (i.e. Google Analytics) which help us understand how much web traffic or app traffic we are receiving, and marketing cookies (i.e. Facebook, Google) which help us track
    the performance of our marketing campaigns, remarket similar products or services to you (including via social media), and create 'lookalike' audiences to find new customers.
    If you view content (i.e. a video) powered by a third party on our website (i.e. YouTube) they will set their own cookies on your browser. All our partners have their own cookie policies, which you can refer to.
    </p>

    <h4>
    The third party cookies we use
    </h4>

    <p>
    Below is a sample of significant third party cookies we use on our website for the purposes of analysis or marketing.
    </p>

    <p>

    </h4>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p><b>
    Marketing:</b> To market new products or features to you via other channels like social media, and to create similar audience profiles (sometimes called 'lookalike audiences') we can market to, so we can target advertising to new customers
    </p>

    <p><b>
