</p>
<h3>Collection of Personal Information</h3>
<p>
When you engage in certain activities on this site, you may be asked to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, you may be required to provide personal information, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and other personal identifying information.
</p>
<p>
When you submit personal information, you understand and agree that The Blue Gem Tattooing may transfer, store, and process your information in any of the countries in which The Blue Gem Tattooing maintain offices, including without limitation, the United States.

<p>
The Blue Gem Tattooing collects this information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select. The Blue Gem Tattooing also uses information that you provide as part of our effort to keep you informed about product upgrades, special offers, and other The Blue Gem Tattooing products and services.

<h3>Embedded content from other websites</h3>
<p>
Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
</p>
<p>
These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.
</p>
<h3>Analytics</h3>
<p>
This website uses Google Analytics to help analyze how visitors use this site. Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are small text files placed on your computer, to collect standard internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. Note the deliberate emphasis of anonymous, as no personally identifiable information, is collected about you unless you explicitly submit that information on this website.
</p>
<p>
The anonymous information generated by Google Analytics cookies about your use of this website is transmitted to Google – not The Blue Gem Tattooing. This information is processed to compile statistical reports on website activity for this site only. The Blue Gem Tattooing uses these reports to evaluate aggregate visitor usage so that we can optimize the content, and its marketing, to better meet your needs. This is essential for The Blue Gem Tattooing to operate this website as a free to use service.
