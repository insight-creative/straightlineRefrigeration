		<h1>Thank You for Your Interest in Our Work!</h1>
		<p>
			We want to take a second to let you know how much we appreciate your interest in our work. We work hard to create custom artwork for each and every client that we work with.
		</p>
		<p>
			While we're normally extremely busy at the shop we will do our best to respond to you within 24 hours. We know how exciting getting your next tattoo is so we'd hate to keep you waiting.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you have a burning question and want a quicker answer, don't hesitate to call us at <a href="tel:(555)468-3090" class="plainLink">(555)468-3090</a> and we'll gladly help you out in any way that we can.
		<p>
			Feel free to get to know us more on social media, we'd love to chat with you!
